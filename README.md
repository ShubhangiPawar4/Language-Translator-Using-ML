## *3. Project Description*

*Multi Language Translator* is a web-based application that allows users to *convert speech or text into translated audio in multiple languages*.

### *Purpose:*

* To help users *communicate across languages easily* by providing real-time translation and speech output.
* To make learning and communication accessible and interactive with voice-enabled features.

### *Key Features:*

* Voice input using microphone for speech recognition.
* Text input or file upload for translation.
* Real-time translation into 18 languages using *Neural Machine Translation (NMT)*.
* Text-to-speech generation in the target language using *deep learning-based TTS (WaveNet)*.
* Option for slow speech for better comprehension.
* Translation history saved within the session.

### *Technologies & Algorithms Used:*

* *Python Libraries:* Streamlit, gTTS, SpeechRecognition, deep-translator
* *Machine Learning / AI Models:*

  * *Speech Recognition:* Deep learning models for audio-to-text conversion
  * *Translation:* Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models
  * *Text-to-Speech:* WaveNet / deep neural networks for natural-sounding speech
* *Frontend / UI:* Custom animated Streamlit interface with gradients, glassmorphism, and interactive buttons.
